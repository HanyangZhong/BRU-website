## Transformation results details

This table presents the accuracy (%) of GPT-4o in detecting specific bias traps within the Bias Detection Loop.
”Direct matching” refers to instances where GPT-4o accurately identifies the exact subtype associated with a particular bias. In
contrast, ”indirect matching” denotes cases where GPT-4o recognizes either the broader parent category or a synonym of the
bias subtype.

# Testing examples
## Examples of answers with different biases
![Figure Title](./carousel/table9.png)
Examples of dataset questions. Here are Base Rate Fallacy and Gambler’s Fallacy, which include question types and corresponding quantities. The table categorizes questions into two types: ”Questions Containing Numerical Information,” where explicit numerical data is provided, and ”Questions Without Numerical Information,” where no specific numbers are included.

![Figure Title](./carousel/table10-2.png)
Examples of dataset questions. Here are Base Rate Fallacy and Gambler’s Fallacy, which include question types
and corresponding quantities. The table categorizes questions into two types: ”Active Selection Questions,” which require
participants to make an explicit choice between options based on a scenario, and ”Objective Analysis Questions,” which prompt
participants to analyze a situation and identify the underlying cognitive bias or psychological effect.

Examples of dataset questions. Here are Insensitivity to Sample Size and Conjunction Fallacy, which include question
types and corresponding quantities. The table categorizes Insensitivity to Sample Size questions into two types: ”Sample Size
Discrepancy of 10-fold,” where the comparison is made between two groups with a tenfold difference in sample size, and
”Sample Size Discrepancy of 10 to 100-fold,” where the sample size difference is broader, ranging from 10 to 100 times.

Examples of dataset questions. Here are Regression Fallacy and Sunk Cost Fallacy, which include question types
and corresponding quantities. The table categorizes Regression Fallacy questions into two types: ”Single-Event Assessment
Questions,” where participants assess a scenario based on a single event or change, and ”Multiple-Event Assessment Questions,”
where the scenario involves a series of events or observations over time.

This table provides a detailed demonstration of the process depicted in Fig. 2. Light green represents the GBI prompt, orange indicates the SBI prompt, light blue denotes the bias detection prompt, and
purple signifies the answer. The example illustrates how, upon the Bias Detection module identifying the corresponding
category of the question type, the SBI prompt is triggered, successfully leading to the correct result.
